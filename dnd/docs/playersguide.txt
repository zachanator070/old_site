|Races|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-Average Joe
	Just your run of the mill guy. You were just like every other kid in
	the sandbox and had straight B's your whole life. Regardless of the
	fact that you mom told you how special you really were 	you never 
	really quite achieved anything in life besides winning the 4th grade
	spelling bee. Being average these days however is quite rare.
	
	*1 extra feat
	*4 extra skill points to start with

	
-Android
	Forged from the steel of machines and the flesh of man your human
	ailments are no more. You may choose robotic limbs of your liking 
	and you are able to get future upgrades for them in the future, 
	dependent upon the fact that you can find someone to do it.

	*+1 strength
	*+1 constitution
	*-2 dex
	*has potential for limb replacement upgrades

	
-Ghoul
	The radiation of this world has made your flesh weak from the 
	unstable conditions you were exposed to. You have a hard time 
	keeping your skin from falling off and keeping your hair from 
	falling out. Your appearance causes many to flee but can cause your
	enemies to tremble. Because of these circumstances you have been 
	blessed with the gift, or curse, of an extended life. Your average 
	ghoul can have a nice life of 300 years, that is of course if he 
	makes it that long.

	*+1 wisdom
	*+1 constitution
	*-2 charisma
	*+5 radiation resistance
	*Terrifying Presence feat
	


-Mutant
	Radiation at birth is a sad and rare occurrence indeed. More often 
	than ever, irradiated young are abandoned due to thier abnormalities
	and rapid declining mental state. Fortunately for you though you 
	love having a third limb! That extra hand really is useful for an 
	extra pistol or the fact that your alien sized eyes	make you see 
	that much better. Of course with every good thing there is a bad 
	one. Choose wisely.

	*1 helpful abnormality
	*1 inhibiting mutation
	*-3 radiation resistance
	*+1 intelligence

its natural(?) inhabitants. At level 1 savages may have an animal familiar
and later have an animal companion at level 5. They may also beserk going

reckless attacking.

As a lad you enjoyed taking the toaster apart and back together again at

a car engine. At age 19 you hacked the PSN and almost got thrown in federal
prison for it. Armed with your knowledge of mathematics, Java, and 
rudimentary robotics, you are able to construct a robot familiar and later
gather enough parts for a robotic companion. Although you are the only person
around that seems to be able to program anything worth 2 Voltz, you can 't
lift a computer tower more than 2 feet.

|Items|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-------

*this lists a few of the basic things that you may encounter 
      	    and is in no way a complete list*


-Scrap bolts (100 voltz)
	Represents 1 lb of small metal objects. Items may be 
	converted to scrap metal but not vice versa. Used in
	various schematics and considered versatile when 
	fixing things as well. Can be obtained from any 
	mechanical structure but such structure is disassembled 
	and deemed unusable till fixed with more bolts.

	
-Battery (worth its capacity)
	
	
-Food 
	Food is so rare it is it's own currency and is extremely 
	valuable in the vast waste. Many people will be very 
	hesitant to part with their food as it could be thier 
	last meal. Foods can be crafted	and obtained other ways 
	though. Normal food give off 1d10 radiation points when 
	consumed. Well prepared organic food gives significantly
	more health and is not irradiated, good luck finding it 
	though. 


---|MEDS|---
	Meds are a valuable commodity as well and are quite rare:

-Rad B Gone
	From the makers of RadX and RadAway, Pipboy industries 
	gives us another great product to help clear away that 
	pesky radiation that exists well... everywhere.
	
	(-RADs)

	
-Smarts
	Smarts earned its street name from dealers around the 
	city who advertise that	you will get "smarts" from it.
	Other side effects have been noted to be apparent 
	besides the increase in brain functionality.
	
	(+WIS, +INT, -STR)
	
	
-Crystal
	Recent drug activity has started circulation of 
	methamphetamines and a particular one known as crystal
	known for its slight blue hue and its effects on reflex 
	reactions. Of course too much of a good thing couldn't 
	possibly be bad.
	
	(+CON, -DEX)
	

-StimPak
	Government circulation of StimPaks have made this drug
	a common site in the wastes as people find a way to 
	get rid of nerves and prepare for battle. Increased 
	blood flow in the user makes blood clotting occur at 
	a much slower rate which has its effects as well.	

	(+DEX, -CON)
	
		
-Rage
	Users of the street drug known as rage have been 
	reported as unstoppable. Rapid muscle growth and cell 
	division are some common effects from this drug but a
	deterioration of brain matter seems to compensate for
	the sudden change in muscle mass. 
	
	(+STR, -WIS)
	
	
--|MELEE WEAPONS|--

-Baseball Bat (1d6+1) (crit 19-20 x2)
	Hit a homer with this crude weapon. Hit as hard as 
	you want but has a 10% chance to break each swing.

-Improvised blunt weapon(1d4+2) (crit 20 x2)
	Don't have much? use anything blunt! has 30% chance
	to fail and break.

-Shiv (1d6) (crit 19-20 x2)
	Close quarters makeshift blade made to do 
	the dirty work.

-Baton (1d6) (crit 19-20 x2)
	Useful for crowd control or just beating the tar 
	out of someone. Has a shorter range than you think.

How to determine damage with an explosive weapon:

damage = weapon damage

-----------
|Mechanics|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-----------

~~~Your Turn~~~

Your turn consists of 1 movement and 1 attack or 2 movements.
When your character level's up enough they will be able to make 2 attack moves.

~~~Attacking~~~

Attack roll: Any weapon - use d20 and add weapon skill/3
			 
			 
Damage roll: Melee - use weapon damage dice plus str modifier plus weapon skill/3
       	     Ranged - use weapon damage dice plus bullet damage weapon skill/3
			 
Ammo: Each ranged weapon has a fire rate. Fire rate determines ammunition used to make a single successful attack per turn.

~~~Radiation~~~

Radiation resistance is the value that radiation startst to take effect.

ex: You have a radiation resistance of 5. You eat some food that makes you take 1d10 of radiation. 
	You roll a 4. Because 4 < 5 you take no effect from it. You then fall into a trap and take 7 radiation from
	water. 7 > 5 therefore you take on 7 points of radiation. 

The effects of radiation are determined as such:

<10		no ill effects

11-25 	-1 str
		-1 dex
		
25-40	-2 str
		-1 dex
		-1 con
		
40-55	-2 str		
		-1 dex
		-2 con
		
55-70	-2 str
		-2 dex
		-2 con
		
80-90	-2 str
		-2 dex
		-2 con
		-2 wis

>90		-2 str
		-2 dex
		-2 con
		-2 wis
		-2 cha

|ARC Weapons|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-------------

ARC weaponry are used quite differently in that they use ARC batteries
which are a miracle in the technological world. ARC batteries are able
to self recharge per 24 hours. The energy stored within them has such
high voltage though that they are rendered almost useless as they short
circuit anything connected to them. Because of thier mysterious origins,
sone say that this stored energy is nuclear where others claim it to be
of another world. Despite the technology that actually surrounds these 
batteries, there are select devices that are found throughout the waste
that are able to harness this energy. Most usable devices are in forms
of weapons and require an amount of wattage per use. Each ARC battery 
is recharged at the end of each day.

Saving throws can be made against ARC weapons are made as such:

10 + save mod > 10 + caster level + (wattage of weapon / 10)

			   	FORT save halves.

Electro-puncture	20 WATT Facial electro needles that increase 
			   	discuise rating by 5.
