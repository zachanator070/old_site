Kind of alien

	Gundark tribe worships Alenia the goddess of the hunt but their statue is made of a metal

	with strange writings not of this world. Players are told they will know the secret of the 
	
	"dookey-boomstick" when they are inducted into the tribe. The rite of passage is an underground
	
	maze with a large worm at the end. Bartok will show them a cave at the base of a mountain 
	
	that leads to the submit where a downed	spacecraft is found. Players find power crystals 
	
	in the space craft as a reward. Bartok will also explain about the titians that the groups worship.
	
	He explains how Alenia shot and brought the space craft down long ago to show the other titians of her
	
	power and earned her right as a Titan.
