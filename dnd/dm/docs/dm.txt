|Main Plot|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-----------

	Players wakeup from cryogenic sleep to find themselves trapped underground in a government
	
	research facility. They find the facility power only half functional. They find basic gear and
	
	are met by Barry. Dr. Barry is a ghoul that has his lower jaw severed that has stumbled upon 
	
	the research facility and was trapped inside it as he was powering on systems and caused a short
	
	that left the security systems and door locks powered. The players may be startled at first by
	
	his appearance but he helps them to find the power. Feral are keeping the party on thier toes
	
	and they must defeat a rather large feral to get to the main entryway and exit the dungeon.
	
	They must then escape from RFac #7.


	The first thing players see is Sam's Pub and Dr Barry suggests players to head there
	
	At Sam's they meet Sam who explains that the the city is in a predicament 
	
	where it is under threat from the monsters of the island known as titians
	
	but they are kept at bay because of the use of a "psionic emmiter" which is
	
	alegidly under control of the newkirk city governor who claims himself as the protector 
	
	of the island. He has kept himself in power because of this claim of housing the 
	
	psyonic emmiter. Sam hires players to go on a hunting trip to a nearby housing complex
	
	known to have skeevers
	
	
	Players are hired to find a Wrym which has found its way into the sewer system. After 
	
	following its trail of acid burns players find that it has burrowed with its acid
	
	into a highly secured vault, the vault that is supposidly holding the psionic emmiter
	
	but it is empty. After players kill the wyrm, the governor attempts to bribe them with 
	
	voltz to keep quiet about it. He tells them to come pick it up at a remote location and 
	
	plans to kill them there. A lone mercinary comes and helps that players fight off the 
	
	mercinary and takes them to a shark who is trying to find out the secret surrounding the 
	
	psionic emmiter. The mercinary shows players a rare sharks tooth as a symbol that he is
	
	from a shark.


	The shark tells players the emmiter could be housed within one of the competing civilizations.
	
	Either the Recon, Cult of Zara, Gundarks, Forsaken, or Sam's pub. He tells players  that 
	
	the Recon would be a good starting place as they are currently hiring. He gives them a sharks
	
	tooth as a sign that they are now contracted under a shark.
	
	
	The Recon will hire players to retrieve a hard drive from RFac #11. The mayor will aproach
	
	players and tell them to look at the contents of the disk for the truth behind the Recon.
	
	Players will see that the Recon have been gathering government failed experiments.
	
	When asked about this Recon will respond that it is thier mission as an organization to 
	
	scour the wasted city in an attempt to preserve as much knowledge as possible whether that
	
	be books, digital data, or technology.
	
	
	Newkirk Mayor will then hire players to assasinate Forsaken leader claiming they are planning 
	
	to raid the Newkirk townstead. When confronted about this the forsaken will strip players of weapons
	
	before talking to thier leader. The leader will tell players that the governor is lying because he
		
	does not wish to let thier kind into the city. The forsaken then hire players to do the exact same thing to 
	
	the Newkirk Governor double the hit price, and offer a new course of history.
	
	
	Upon asassination of the governor players will find out that the forsaken do not have the emmiter either. News 
	
	that the governor did not have the psionic emmiter spreads and funding to the city stops. Rumors spread that
	
	the sharks are looking for new investments.
	
	
	The forsaken will then hire players to search RFac #2 for signs of development of nuclear weapons in order
	
	to win the sharks over and receive thier funding. Players will find research notes and referance 
	
	to the location of possible nukes on "Roosevelt." The surviving leader will then reveal that 
	
	they are not the ones with the sonic emmiter. While exiting RFac #2 players will be ambushed
	
	by the gundark tribe and taken to be sacrificed to thier alian Goddess Alenia.
	
	
	Players will have to convince thier way out of being sacrificed but are then abliged to enter in a rite of passage
	
	in the "boogie"(swamp maze) to hunt for a frost wyrm which proves to be quite difficult. Players will be revealed
	
	that the gundarks have no idea what the psionic emmiter is and do not have it either. 
	
	
	Upon returning to the Forsaken, players will be explained how the forsaken want to declare war against the Cult
	
	of Zara in order to eliminate possible benefactors of the sharks. They however cannot do it alone and want to 
	
	recruit the Recon to help them as well. Players will be	tasked with recruiting the Recon with some sort of 
	
	craftable item or be tasked to retrieve a water purifier from a fallen Recon scout in a nearby RFac that is 
	
	infested with some sort of nasty creatures. Recon will agree to help the Forsaken with the war effort by 
	
	suppling weapons.
	
	
	The Forsaken will then task players to head to a Zara cult outpost and kill its inhabitants and thier 
	
	war monster as well. Players will have to mark the destroyed outpost with the Forsaken symbol of a 
	
	skull on fire and bring back a head of the war animal as proof of thier work. While headed to the 
	
	outpost players will be greated with a messanger from a shark bribing them to not kill the monster
	
	as the sharks do not want Recon and Forsaken to work together. The messanger will give players a 
	
	sharks tooth to signify his authenticity. 
	
	
	At some point after this players get a desperate messange from Sam's pub that they are needed.
	
	Sam will tell players that a mother and her baby were taken away into the sewer by large reptilian
	
	creatures and that they want players to go after them and hopefully rescue them. Upon fighting 
	
	through the sewers players find the Skeet who are large intelligent reptilian creatures that 
	
	have basic vocabulary learned from a childrens book that they hold as sacred. Players learn that 
	
	the skeeth have taken the woman and child as they did not want to be discovered and perhaps 
	
	eat them later. Players can convince the skeeth by killing the jigoa (a large serpant) that is housed
	
	in the Roosevelt Research Facility #3 which is deep underground and is housing the long lost nukes.
	
	The players will find the jigoa in the nuclear silo holding the nukes. The Jigoa will block thier entryway
	
	and players will climb up the silo and find that they are on Roosevelt island by some plaques and statues 
	
	of a war hero.
	
	
	At this point the players will be confronted with the choice of giving the nukes to whom they please.
	
	Each faction will have thier own reasoning:
	
	
	Recon: Will reveal that they have the Emmiter and want to nuke the Titians
	
	Forsaken: Gain funding from the Sharks
	
	Sharks: Power to find the emmiter and control it
	
	Gundarks: Hold the whole island under hostage and rule the island
	
	Sam's Pub: Use it as a power source for thier people, generate money without Sharks

|Mobs|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------

--|Passive|--

	Centipig - multiple legged (6-8) pigs that are mainly used for milk production
	
	Multiheaded chicken - has random amounts of head placed randomly on it. Is rather
				clumsy due to a lack of motor skills from multiple heads. Are used for
				meat production.
				
	Rhinos - large grazing animals that are usually passive and are a rare source of food.
			  Resmbles a hulking rhino with a flat face like a bison covered in small to large
			  horns that are mounted at the top of its head.

--|Small|--

	Mole Rats - 2-3 foot tall large rodants that are used as stock animals.
				Pink colored with no hair or fur.
	
	Lyote - Small scavengars that can be aggressive when threatened. Have small horns
			down the center of thier backs.
	
	Sentry rover - small rover with mounted gun that protects a dedicated area away
				from intruders
	
	K10 - evolved form of dogs known to have multiple heads and dangerous bites. Are 
			known to live both solitary and in packs.
			
	Stokes - flightless birds with sparsely feathered bodies as well as scales. Have
				overly large beaks with small beady eyes. Are scavengers and are known
				to attack in groups when food is scarce. Rare larger mutants exist that
				have breath attacks. Closely resemble raptors body type.
	
--|Medium|--

	Feral - radiated humans that have turned into radiation zombies.
	
	Zara Cultist - known for use of fire weapons, they are relatively unarmored.
	
	Poachers - unaligned humans that attack anyone travelling in their turf.

	Night Stag - hairless horse with pitch black eyes. Thin built built with skin that
					is stretched over its face and body. It is sometimes used as a form
					of transportation as they can be tamed but only with great effort.
	

--|Large|--

	Vyron - Large 4 legged insectoids with 2 large mandibles with claws. Have large incisors
			as well as wings that allow them to jump large distances. Sensitive to flame attacks

	Void Stalker - 4 legged predatory creature that is known for its aggressive behaviour
					Grey smooth skinned with no hair or fur. Have mane's made out of 
					boneless tentacles.

	Wyrm - scale from medium to large reptiles with the smaller ones only able to crawl on 4 legs 
			while the larger ones are fully able to run on 2 large hind legs. Have long necks and
			non functioning wings. Their intelligence, speed and breath attacks make them feared
			hunters.

	Gultch - Large aggressive creature with two large forearms that cary the creature along with 2 
			 double jointed hoofed smaller hind legs. Its head is stooped low with a large brow.
			 Is known for charging on anything that invades its territory and for its use of its
			 large forearms in assaulting its victims. 
			 
--|Colossal|--

	Alenia - Forest Titian, is rarely seen but if "she" is ever she rarely exhibits aggressive behavior.
			 Has been credited with large kills that happen out on the island with use of projectiles.
			 Is not large in size and resembles like a normal human but extremely radiated but exhibits
			 opposite effect from radiation that ghouls show. Her radiation keeps her in pristine condition
			 and her youthfulness has stayed with her throughout the years. Her projectiles that are used are 
			 tipped with some powerful explosive that she "found" from the downed spacecraft. Her exposure to
			 the downed spacecraft is most likely the cause of her condition.
	
	Coatyl
			
			The giant subterranean creature that is credited with the sudden appearance of wyrms throughout the
			island. It is said to be the mother of these creatures although its existance has yet to be confirmed.
			Rumor describes it as a two legged reptilian with a snake like torso and tail. Destructions of settlements
			outside the city have been credited to the Coatyl. For whatever reason it is public opinion that the
			Coatyl is the main reason for the psionic emmiter.
			
	Zara
	
			A flightless creature that keeps to the underground subways of the city. Unlike the rest of the titans
			it is trapped under the city unable to make its escape to the outreaches of the island. Viewed as a 
			form of a diety it is worshiped by cultists above ground who make its location a closely guarded
			secret. It feasts upon any unlucky adventures who wander near its hiding place or any sacrifices that
			are willingly given to it by its cultists. Its body closely resembles a bat without fur and with a long
			neck. It has an underbite and small beady eyes best suited for the dark damp underground tunnels of the 
			subway. It has smooth skin with webbed wings that have not been used for a long time
	
	Tarthus
	
			The most harmless of the titans, Tarthus remains a giant hulk of rock and stone fixed in the island. It
			has never been reported to have moved from its location and is believed to be content there as it has never
			made an attack against the city which it could easily over run. Its head is deep underground and its hot
			breathing can be felt troughout the tunnels that are in the surounding area. None have been brave enough to 
			find the source of breathing in fear of waking the huge monster.
	
	Zuhulu
	
			Although the Zuhulu is almost myth it is still treated as a titan as the monsterous waves and storms from the 
			sea are said to be the wrath of Zuhulu against humanity. It is mere speculation as no sightings have been
			seen of a giant sea creature big enough to match its description. It remains an idea though that the 
			sea remains relentless especially as the Earth's currents have changed from the drastic change of weather
			due to nuclear fallout.
