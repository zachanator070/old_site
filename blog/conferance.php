					 <h3>10 April 2015</h3>
					 <p>
						GENERAL CONFERANCE!!!! What a great week. It is always inspiring to me to see the leaders of the church and to hear them speak. This general conferance
						something kind of crazy happened though. During the sustaining of the leaders (when everyone votes to sustain the leaders of the church) usualy its unanimous
						but THIS time, a whole row of people yelled during the opposing vote. It was kind of scary and killed the spirit of the meeting knowing that there were those 
						there that opposed everything that would be said during the meeting but then it hit me. There have ALWAYS been people that have disagreed with the church. It
						was nothing new. Read about James Gammel for instance. His inlaws almost DIED because of pursecution. Having someone voice thier opinion was the least of my concerns.
						I realized during the rest of the meeting that people are free to belief what they want. If they don't agree with me that's fine. They can live how they want 
						as long as it does not interfere with others. I think the whole stink about it was that they had shouted which was not how you are to show your sign of
						opposition and like I said it kind of killed the spirit of things. Bummer.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						I know that everyone is having a fit about it but that is pretty much how I feel on the matter. If they don't agree that is ok because they have thier liberty just like
						I do. Just let the rest of us worsihp how we want to. Besides that there were some really good talks and things said during the meetings. I think my favorite one was given
						by M. Russel Ballard who said that RM doesn't mean retired mormon. haha. I see his point but I think the hardest part for me coming home from my mission was focusing so much
						on things about my self rather than others. There is a fine balance where you have to focus on your goals and aspirations but also still keeps other's needs in mind. It's 
						something that Alyssum and I are trying to think more about.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Anyway enough controversial topics lets talk about Texas. This past week I read alot about James Gammell's brother William Gammell who, while James was incarserated in
						Australia, moved to Texas with his family. William ended up fighting in the Texas revolution! He was recruited as a immagrant to Mexico and was promised land as well 
						as tax free living. Well to tell you a little bit about Texas history, the land that was promised to immigrants was not given and then taxes soon were imposed and 
						even increased on American Texans. Well if you should know anything about American history it is that Americans don't like taxes. The Texans soon declared independance
						and the Texan revolution began. Well the final battle of the revolution was against the big bad Mexican General Santa Anna (not Santa Claus) and the Texan General Sam
						Houston. Well William Gammell was under the battalion that Sam Houston led into the battle of San Jacento where Santa Anna was captured and the revolution was won.
					 </p>
					  
					 <p>
						So because of his support for the revolution, William Gammell was buried as a war hero later when he died where it was said that Texas had lost one of it's finest 
						citizens. He was burried in Washington Cemetery where other famous Texan war heros resided. So this was really cool to read about. It at first confused me cause I 
						initially thought that James was the one that participated in the revolution but it was actually William Gammell. So to all you Canadians and fellow Texans out there,
						you are welcome. Two of my ancestors fought for your cause. I accept donations in forms of baked goods and cash. You are welcome. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						That little bit was all I had read about this week. A lot of it was background on the Texas revolution but I figured you all knew that becuase you took
						Texas History in 7th grade right? Oh you didn't? Well you should move to Texas, you would learn a thing or two ;) That's it for this week. I would encourage
						you all to go read about conference since there were many good things in there that we all could benefit from. And as always have a great week :D
