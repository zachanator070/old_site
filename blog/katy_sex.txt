Hey Katy I'm looking to write my post tomorrow. Did you have time to prepare any thoughts?
Monday 6:15am
Sorry for the delay! It was a busy weekend.


I believe that sex is a beautiful, sacred act that is reserved for a man and a woman who have made a lifelong 
commitment to one another before God. God designed it that way with our best interests at heart. 
An analogy from my husband: When two people have an intimate relationship, it is like two pieces of tinfoil that 
get clumped together into a ball. If this occurs in a relationship with no real commitment, a break up will inevitably occur. 
When it does, the two pieces will have to be carefully separated. This will most likely result in a few tears or rips in the tinfoil. 
Even if you can escape without a tear, you will never be able to completely smooth out all the wrinkles. You are forever changed. 
That is why God wants us to reserve that act for someone who will always be there and who will never have to be separated from you.


Hope that helps!

It does thank you so much. Would you say that you would only only have sex after marriage or is a committed relationship enough?
To me, a relationship isn't truly committed until marriage. Taking that oath before God is what binds you together forever.

Ok cool. That makes sense. Just one last question. I assume you relate to the christian religion, but do you identify with any denomination? Also would you be ok with me putting your name on the entry? Its ok if you want it to be anonymous.
