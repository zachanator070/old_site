					 <h3>10 March 2015</h3>
					 <p>
						Today we talk about how I almost died. Yup I didn't even think it myself but yes ladies and gentlemen, it
						has been found that too much homework can indeed have the potential to kill you. This was found because this week
						I had a death wish put upon me where a CS project was due and I *only* had one week to do it. So this story was 
						partly my fault I guess but it came down to me, Java, and 10 days where I had to write a http server and have it working
						by the following Wednessday. Part of the problem as well was all the family things that I had to do last weekend too which 
						put things further behind where they needed to be. So yeah I was doomed for failure.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						But having nothing to fear but fear itself I was able to overcome my obstacle of the combined effore of the time crunch
						and the overpowering force of the project design. All in all it was my sheer strength and fortitude that really saved the 
						day and allowed me to perservere to the end. My wits had almost failed me but my trusty 6-shooter had not. For I was
						alone in the dreary waste and conquered my foe, blow after blow until he had given the sign of defeat. I. Was. Victorious.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So if you didn't follow that just know that if you are ever behind on home work you can always just stay up all night the day before it's due and 
						still do fine. In any other class I am in that would totally not work but the project had to pass a specific pass off program 
						which is really black and white when it boils down to it. Now I know all of you are all judging me so hard right now and 
						are thinking to yourself "OMG ZACH IS SUCH A PROCRASTINATOR!! HE IS GOING TO FAIL SCHOOL!!" Ok all of you who are doing that, please shut up now. 
						I only pulled this all nighter after 10 days of working on the thing. I'm pretty sure I averaged 5 hours a day working on that thing so that is
						like what 50 hours?? I'm pretty sure that it was more cause I get home at 5:00 and go to bed at midnight. Minus dinner and pee breaks that is still
						a little more than 5 hours a day.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Anyway so that was the nightmare that I had to go through last week. This weekend on the other hand was really fun. I got to
						go to a beauty pageant. I know sounds kind of wierd right? Well I onlly went to it because of my cousin Jessie Beck who
						had entered in the thing. Now I'll tell you right now she won the whole shebang. There was a $3,000 scholarship awarded to the 
						winner and she won every penny. So there are a couple of theories as to why she won. The first being that I was screaming my head off
						the whole time and led team Jessie to victory. The other being that she was a perfect match for these judges. Out of the four judges there
						was a recently returned senior missionary, an engineer, and a hardcore BYU fan. So knowing that Jessie's platform was STEM education, she
						has just returned home from a mission, and that she is on the BYU rugby team it was only so clear as to who the judges would pick. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						A huge shoutout to Jessie for her victory and all I have to say is: "You're welcome team Jessie. Your fearless leader has yet to 
						let you down."
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So I figured I should talk about James Gammell some more this week too. I started to read the trials that had taken place in London. But 
						the thing that I found dumb was first off JAMES WASN'T EVEN AT THE TRAIL, and also APARENTLY IF YOU ASK FOR A PARDON YOU ARE ASSUMED GUILTY.
						So I think that because of these two facts James was deemed guilty even though 9 of his 12 comrades were given a pardon and sent home to 
						the USA cast out of Canada. So with this very unhappy news he hoped on another boat and began his journey around the world to Australia. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So there were a couple of things that he noted about the journey to Van Dieman's Land (Tasmania). The first was that he and his old buddy Miller
						that he was chained to for the last 6 months of his life were really fond of the surgeon that was on board. They were such good friends with him that
						they got special permission to be his aids. They got thier own room and extra rations from it. The thing about this sweet hookup was that all
						the other inmates on the prison vessel were pretty hostile towards the two about it. So they got a lot of slander and abuse thrown in their way.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Out of the 90 men onboard the ship, "only" 2 died at sea so I guess this doctor was pretty good from what James and Miller write. When they finally 
						arive to Van Dieman's Land they are thrown into a catch 22 situation where they are at first asked to do a little bit of sweeping. Then when they are 
						gradually given more and more work untill they have far too much to bear. Then when they cannot complete tasks they are flogged, but if they refuse to
						work then they are flogged more. So... this place sucks. They are given coarse clothes and shoes that fall apart well before they are allowed new ones.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						While there they hear of an American Trade ship that has stopped to port. Bingo break out time. While they hear of the ship closeby
						Miller is currently assigned guard duty. Convienent right? So Miller lowers a rope down the chimney of the prisoner barraks to James
						and his buddy Grant. Grant gets out first and he lowers the rope again to James. While James is climbing up the chimney, Grant pulls the rope
						up all the way as a practical joke. James falls halfway down the chimney and then sprints back to bed before everyone else in the barraks 
						is able to figure out what the heck just happened. Grant, dude... really???
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So that didn't work like they wanted to and the whole building was awake from James' crash down the fireplace so they couldn't go anywhere for the night.
						The Canadians soon heard of some incoming Frenchman from Canada and so Grant, Miller, and James all requested to be put to work with them. The work they were
						asigned to was to build a hug road from the coastline to the mainland of Australia. The party didn't care though and they were transferred. The work
						was almost unbearable as they were clearing brush and rock while paving a new highway down the middle of the Australia desert. They lived in huts along the
						way and record that they returned home soaking wet from the rain (as it is during the winter time there) and slept cold and wet becuase they were not
						permitted to light a fire. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I left off there cause once again I like to leave the story right when things get really depressing. It seems like that they are never going to escape and I 
						was 100% sure that they last atempt was going to work. Oh well it leaves in suspense I guess. Anyways that's it for this week. I hope that you all have a 
						great time as usual. Peace.
