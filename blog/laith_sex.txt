-growing up what was your views on sex?
	abstinence was not really  a thought. my parents didn't really talk to me about it much. 
	school was all about abstinence but yet I didn't really give it that serious thought
	I was not influenced and had full control over my thoughts and actions and was not
	influenced by my peers.
	I remember the people that advocated it was by religious people and it really turned me off
	
	I believe this is personal belief that is not influenced by religion. I think that 
	cutting the piece of cardboard can be cut many ways. for me it is a part of physicality
	which is partly defined by sex which is why i believe in sex out side of marriage.
