					 <h3>5 Dec 2014</h3>
					 <p>
						Here we are again but for the last time in marriage and family. I know this is a good habit to have to write
						regularly but this next week is finals and the week after that I am getting married so ya. If you can come to the reception on the 23rd in Salt Lake
						or on the 2nd of January in Mckinney. Hope to see you all there! Anyway this last week...
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This last week was crazy as usual with school and I was finaly able to move into my new place. It is nice and roomy(ish) but it will do. I was able to spend most
						of the week end with Alyssum and her family as we went to church on Sunday together and then we went to a wonderful Christmas devotional later that night. Saturday 
						Alyssum and I were able to go out with her cousin Mathew and his wife Taylor who is three months pregnant yay! It was great to be out with them and it was an
						opportunity I seized to talk to a realitively new couple as they begin thier marriage. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						You see this past little while in class we were talking about major differences between men and women and why there were problems when it came to marriage 
						concerning these issues. Most of the things we discussed in class were about communication and understanding each other problems as this is a huge difference in 
						the way that both sexes generally approach each of these problems. You could almost taste my feeling of expectancy when Mathew described to us one problem that he and 
						Taylor faced early on which was the way they deal with problems. He said that there was a little bit of frustration when it came to this because when faced with a problem 
						Mathew always tried to fix it. So when Taylor came to him with problems he would try to make suggestions on how to fix the issue but all Taylor really wanted was for him to 
						just listen. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Alyssum and I both kind of giggeld at each other as this was one of the very problems we talked about in class how men generally try to attack problems and fix them right away while 
						women will generally just want to talk about things even though they already have an idea about what they are going to do. To follow up with this Taylor
						explains to us that she is kind of an emotional person and that sometimes you just have to cry to get things off your chest. Crying was a way to 
						release built up emotion and sometimes its ok to do it. For me I don't really like crying but hearing this was good for me because it always scared me or confused me
						because of my assumption that something was wrong or that I had wronged someone but in fact it was just one of those times that crying was just good.
					</p>

						The thing that both Taylor and Mathew put a lot of emphasis on was understanding how to show love to one another. They referenced a popular idea about "love languages"
						and how some people express and receive love different ways. For example Mathew associated service and his willingness to do the dishes as a sign of love to Taylor but
						really all Taylor wants was for him to spend time with her. To her sitting down and talking was more important than physical acts of kindness but that was just 
						her preferance in how she wanted to spend time or receive love. I understand this totally as every person is different and Mathew and Taylor explained how this takes a
						while to grasp but to be patient when both parties are trying really hard to make the other one happy. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						One thing Taylor brought up too was how she had problems at first being ok while Mathew was away from home. Her anxiety and state of mind was something that she
						she really struggled with especially when Mathew was away for work or doing church service. For her it was a personal struggle that she had to over come and 
						come to terms with as it was going to be something that she couldn't do much except to just deal with it and finding the strength to do so.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						All in all it was a really nice thing to get to know Mathew and Taylor and for the wisdom that they were able to share with Alyssum and I. It she some
						light onto some potential bumps in the road that could happen early on in the course of marriage. It helped us ask the hard questions that we had only
						skimmed about but now are clearly defined. This short talk was really good and I really hope to be in Taylor and Mathews shoes one day. Anyway that's it for 
						this week. As always have a good one out there and remember who you are!
