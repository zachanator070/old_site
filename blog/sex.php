					 <h3>3 Nov 2014</h3>
					 <p>
						 Last week was something that was a little off beat in that I talked to a couple of people about
						 a subject that I thought was not visited as much as it should. Sex. But I focused on what other people
						 thought and how they were influenced about thier decision about abstenince. I did this in a pursuit of answering 
						 a question of how I felt about the subject myself to answer it the same way to someone else. This week I will 
						 atempt to do so after careful review of what others have said and studying it out in my mind for a time as well.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The first thing that came to mind was an "article of faith" that Joseph Smith used to define the beliefs of a Latter-Day Saint
						and I think it is entirely appropriate here to describe the level of respect that I have towards other people concerning thier beliefs. 
						The article states that "We believe in worshiping the almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience and allow all men the
						same priviledge how, where or what they may." I believe that sex is a most precious gift from God that we are able to use to express love and 
						to bring the children of God into this world. Because I believe this it does not mean that I believe that every one should be forced to believe
						this idea as well. Joseph Smith's description of respect towards other people's religion applies very much so in this case and has been
						a theme in my life that I try very hard to uphold as I would expect others to do unto me.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						With that said the basis of my beliefs stems from the christian belief against fornication and adultery. We can look as far back to the
						story of the creation where one of the first commandments God gave to man was to "multiply and replenish the Earth" while he later defines this
						more in the ten commandments which is definately more explicit than anything up to that point. Considering these two very early examples of 
						direct commandments from God it is aparent that there is a specific way that God intended for us to use our bodies in terms of sexuality.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						There are other examples of early definitions of the christian beliefs on sex but I wanted to use one that is rather different from the rest and
						it comes from the presidency from the LDS church in The Family: A Proclomation to the World. Which has many things besides one I think that the rest of the
						christian world would agree upon. The phrase that I love from this document states that "that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children."
						I could not agree more with this as this clearly defines what I believe that God has planned for us. It is odd to think that the begining of this statement
						is widely controversial in todays terms of social definitions but I would like to think that my beliefs are not based upon simply what other people
						think or say but what I think God has shown to me.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I think it takes a rather spiritual person to understand this next part but these thoughts and feelings are not based simply upon the fact that
						someone else said them. In fact, from being a missionary I have learned that that is the worst way you can come to belive something while the best way
						is to search it out in your heart and to seek inspiration from God about it. I believe that God continues to talk to us today and that prayer is one
						such way that we can do this with him. To think that a God would create with out guiding is beyond my definition of a benevolent God. Because of this
						I honestly have searched and have felt it in my heart that this is what God would have me to. To a non-religious person this may seem nonsensical as feelings 
						have no foundation of truth but to me they are the very definition of it for it is through this way that I believe God communicates through us. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						With that being the primary reason for what I believe I would like to give a second being example. I have seen many people throughout my life model such a life
						like this where sex is a sacred act to be saved for marriage and inspires me to live like that as well. On the flip side I have seen violations of this 
						principle become violated and has absolutely destroyed realtionships, hearts, and lives. I understand that there are many things that can cause heartache
						but in my life I do not want this to be one of those things. I think the amount of damage cause by it far outweighs the happiness generated by it by keeping it 
						sacred. 
					</p>

					<p>
						By now I hope that one can see that I view sex as one of the top 5 most important things you do in this life. With the other 4 things I believe that this
						should be a serious decision in ones life and that it is not a frivolous or light hearted thing. It is the ultimate act of affection and should only be used 
						when you think of it as this. I believe that if you are not married to someone then you do not understand if you love them enough to be commited. Commitment is 
						a huge part of my definition of love and because of this I do not believe that the sacred act of sex should be used with someone who you are not fully convinced that you
						love.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Well if you have gotten this far and are absolutely appalled it doesn't suprise me as this is a rather unpopular point of view but to you I would refer to the very first point
						I tried to make. To every man his own and the respect that comes with that as well. Thank you all once again and I hope that you have a great week and maybe think about sex a little 
						bit differently as well.
