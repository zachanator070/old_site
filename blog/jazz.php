				 <h3>1 March 2015</h3>
				 <p>
					 Hey all! This week was kinda fun but kind of stressful at the same time. I guess I should mention the fun stuff to begin with
					 so you all aren't going to stop reading by the second paragraph. So first off this last week I was able to go to my grandmas house for 
					 our monthly dinner. That is always a blast cause we are always treated to a really nice meal by my grandma Furniss and get to enjoy
					 the company of the rest of our family. Everytime I go there is a devotional given by a member of our family and I am always so grateful
					 to have such a wonderful family. Shout out to all of you and thank you all for everything that you have done for me.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
					On the other hand everytime we go there is a mass amount of energy released by little cousins. Of course the amount of energy in the 
					room of course amasses to mad chaos of screaming and laughing. This of course is the best kind of birth control to young
					parents like ourselves. Example A: JENSEN FURNISS. My friend you are one crazy little man and need to chill out. I have the utmost
					respect for Matt and Cristi as they try to handle that little tasmanian devil.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
					So besides grandma's house we were able to go to a Jazz game with Alyssum's parents which was of course awesome. I never really have
					enjoyed basketball as much as the next guy but this was pretty fun. Alyssum's dad had some really great tickets to share with us and 
					it was really fun. The most action I would say would be from the mascott who was constantly berating the fans, refs, and players alike.
					It reminded me of Cosmo, the BYU mascott, who is like 1000x funnier by the way. We won the game only after hearing 30 minutes of the
					drunk guys behind us act like idiots and the grandma beside us express her frustration with the team as well. Utan needs a football
					team because the fans can only get so dissapointed with a basketball team. Haha. Regardless of that the Jazz still won and it was
					a pretty good game after all.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
					Next up we have our weekly report about James Gammell. Last week I read about he miraculously made it across the Atlanic and made it
					safely into the Liverpool harbor. After recovering in Liverpool they were led onto an ironclad to journey through the English Chanel 
					to England. Little did they know they would face the roughest storm that has ever been recorded to happen. The situation seemed the
					same that they had on the Captain Ross where the prisoners were thrown below deck where the most horrid combination of puke,
					filth and sea water would gather. Upon reaching port James Gammell made an effort to write a letter of appreciation to the captain 
					for their safe arival to England.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
					Once again I was able to see a great character quality among these men. Regardless of thier situation they greatly appreciated the 
					service of those who were around them. I mentioned this before but to me it seems very unusual that men of this nature would 
					be considered religious and show respect to their captors. If you would think about now adays how are the criminals of this world
					viewed as? I would dare say that the majority of that population would fall into these characteristics. Truely these men were 
					were different.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
					When they made it to London they found the city in a pitiful state. They were housed on a prison boat off shore becuase there was literaly 
					no room left in the ones on the mainland. It was mentioned in the biography that England at the time was like that in the writings of
					Charles Dickens where poverty was a huge problem and things like child labor and sewage were huge problems to the populous as well. It was 
					noted by James and his comrads that they were treated better than most of the citizens because of the starvation among the people. The jails
					were overcrowded from debtors, women, and children from all the horrific social issues that were occuring at the time.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
					This is were I stopped for the week because of how depressing the story got. It reminded me of Great Expectations which I hate. It reminded
					me of how much I hate Charles Dickens' writing which of course is not a happy thought for me as well. But anyway it was still amazing to
					see the character of James Gammell and the amazing things that he witnessed in his crazy life. I hope none of you this week end up on
					a prison ship or have to live in sewage cause from what is happening to James it doesn't sound too fun. Have a great week everyone!
