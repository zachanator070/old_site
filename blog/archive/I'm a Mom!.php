						\t So first off happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there. My Mother's Day was a little bit different considering my own mother
					  left me and sisters to rule the house for a week. It was pretty awesome till I realized that my mom was depending on me to be responsible for taking 
					  care of everything and driving everyone around. After hearing this I was like "lol wut??" which looked something like this:
					  </br>
					  </br>

					  </br>
					  </br>
						\t But I got used to driving everywhere and feeding everyone every night and before I knew it I looked something more like this:
					  </br>

					  </br>
						\t If there was one thing that I learned from this whole expirience of parenthood it's that you don't want to be in the Johnson
					  home on a Wednessday night. Between making sure everyone at from when they got home at 4 to Tyler's doctor appointment
					  at 5 then coming home and getting Sophie volleyball practice at 6 then to mutual right after at 7 then driving Tyler to his activity 
					  downtown then coming late to pick up Sophie at 9:00 because of Tyler's going late and realizing she already got a ride home, I was ready by 
					  the end of the day to sleep. 
					  </br>
						\t After doing all of this and keeping the house at a moderately clean level and keeping enough food in the house to keep us alive, my mom
						still came home and found 9824379857927642943875924 things that I failed to do and keep track of. I think all the quilting up in Utah 
						must have gotten to my mom or something cause it was a miracle that the house didn't end up like this:
