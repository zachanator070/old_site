me: hey babe

Gorinne Criggs:
Hey sexy
You guys are weird. ha ha

me:
yeah so u want to ncmo????

Gorinne Criggs:
Not tonight, I'm a little tired.

me:
from all the other love we have been getting on?? yeah you are right
rest those peckers and we will fire em up tomorow

Gorinne Criggs:
Ok, sounds like a plan, although I might be a little tired after band class...

me:
screw the oboe my lips taste better than wood

Gorinne Criggs:
debatable

me:
no fact

Gorinne Criggs:
What if I happen to like the taste of wood?

me:
then we can wedge a reed between our passionate faces

Gorinne Criggs:
That could get dangerous
We might end up with splinters in our lips

me:
or end up with a night in which the chemistry cant stop lowing
flowing*
or lowing 
if you are into that kinda thing
we can make anything happen

Gorinne Criggs:
Oh, I don't  doubt it

me:
so tonight under the moon when the clock reaches 12?

Gorinne Criggs:
Can't wait

me:
no neither can i

Gorinne Criggs:
Don't be too offended if I don't show up, I might have found a better offer by then
me:
that was cold. 

Corinne is offline.
11:00pm
Corinne is online.
11:00pm

Gorinne Criggs:
It could be worse

me:
like me leaving you in the rain holding nothing but a wilted flower?

Gorinne Criggs:
First you have to give me a flower

me:
with your heart crushed and shredded from the piercing words that come out of my own heart that has no sympathy from snivelling girl like yourself

Gorinne Criggs:
Oh that was harsh, I think I might go cry myself to sleep.

me:
good right after reading that dear susie that i left for you on your pillow that leaves you absolutely heart broken from my harsh feelings towards your groveling at my feet
speechless i see?

Gorinne Criggs:
You'd like to think that

me:
i hope the darkness that is in your heart has swallowed up your words as well
along with that radiating light that used to come out of the sparkling gems that are your eyes
No longer does that laugh come out of you!

Gorinne Criggs:
It's not my fault if you were never sexy enough or good enough to keep me. You know, some guys are just so irresistible that you could never measure up to them. 
That passion that we had just doesn't even compare anymore.
In the end, you just weren't man enough for me
Speechless?

me:
NAY!!!

Gorinne Criggs:
.....
Imagine the jeopardy song playing right now
I can't wait to see what all 6 of you came up with

me:
i will never have enough words to spill to you about how hurt and disappointed i am from all that potential that was building up!
the sexual tension was just boiling in my blood

Gorinne Criggs:
Clearly. 

me:
BUT YOU DID NOTHING
u just stood there and taunted me the whole time while i just dont resist the thought of you

Gorinne Criggs:
I waited, and waited, and waited

me:
you WERE THE BIGGEST TEAST
TEASE

Gorinne Criggs:
And now, words fail me

me:
GOOD
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER FEELINGS THAT WE USED TO HOLD DEAR TO US!!!!

Gorinne Criggs:
I know and I cannot express how deeply hurt I am because of that or how much I miss it and think of it constantly. I can't breathe every time I think about you and just wonder what could have been. sigh

me:
how did you make sigh bold??

Gorinne Criggs:
I'll never reveal my secrets

me:
YOU WHENCH!!!! 
after all i have done for you
you would be nothing without me
you would still be that little shrivelled up thing from kansas
montana i mean

Gorinne Criggs:
I'm glad you have so much confidence in yourself, when you consider the effect I had on your life. But I don't know what you did to deserve learning how to bold words.
Wow
or should I say wow

me:
or wow
my talents supersede yours
im still AMAZED

Gorinne Criggs:
not really

me:
about how you can yet say anything
just witty comments that have no feelings atatched
comment on my spelling and you will wake up with cockroaches in your bed

Gorinne Criggs:
at least I have the witty part
And I think that would be against the honor code

me:
covered in mayonnaise with BBQ sauce
along with MORE WITTY PUNS!!!

Gorinne Criggs:
Sorry, I don't think I've heard anything witty from you yet.
And I've never really been that atatched to puns.

me:
the puns are meant to hurt u
the mayo and cockroaches are an insult
as for attractiveness.....
ill sigh a pic and leave it for you
sign*
hopefully that arouse you enough to come over here and get some goodness

Gorinne Criggs:
Hm, conceited and delusional?

me:
get over here
kiss me now
this cant keep going on forever

Gorinne Criggs:
I know, I can't fight this feeling anymore.

me:
come
enbrace me
embrace*

Gorinne Criggs:
Sorry, I've decided to play hard to get.

me:
YOU ARE SOOOO HOT

Gorinne Criggs:
You haven't proved yourself to me first. As much as it pains me to stay away from you, I need to know that you won't just leave me in the rain with a wilted flower.

me:
KISSS MMMEEEE NOOOOOOWWWWW
OH I CANT STAND IT!!!

Gorinne Criggs:
It isn't 12 o clock yet.

me:
i dont care
the tension is too great

Gorinne Criggs:
sigh I know, I feel it too

me:
come to me
lets GET IT ON

Gorinne Criggs:
Maybe we should take this a little slow...

me:
love knows no time frame

Gorinne Criggs:
In that case, couldn't it wait?

me:
no saliva is building up
its just uncontrollable 

Gorinne Criggs:
Gross, why would I kiss you with a mouth full of saliva...

me:
its only a reaction that can be cure with LOVE
cured*

Gorinne Criggs:
Maybe, but I'm not sure love will cure your spelling
But I think my love might just be great enough to overlook that flaw

me:
love is blinding

Gorinne Criggs:
True, but my gag reflex isn't, sorry hun, but you're going to have to fix that salivating thing.

me:
love can cure all. just say it and it will be so 

Gorinne Criggs:
But if all we have is a ncmo, I don't know if my heart can handle it, I just love you so much that I want us to be so much more than a one night stand.
And now it's 15 minutes to midnight, I don't know if I'll be able to stay away anymore.

me:
babe this can last a lifetime

Gorinne Criggs:
I'm beginning to see that now.

me:
then lets make it happen
im waiting out here in the cold for you
i could use some warming up

Gorinne Criggs:
I could too, but I haven't heard you knock on my door. I'm so lonely without you.

me:
i cant its past curfew
but i can see you through your window
you = gorgeous

Gorinne Criggs:
Awwww, you are way too smooth for my own good, I really don't think I can stay away now

me:
STOP STALLING!!!!
KISS ME NOAAAAAWWWWW!!!!!

Gorinne Criggs:
I can't, you're not here with me. I can see the light in your window and it seems to far away, so unreachable that it feels like I can never quite get to you, that maybe we'll never be but I want you so bad that I want to take that leap of faith to make it happen. 

me:
quit yer wining and get over here and pucker up

Gorinne Criggs:
It's past curfew

me:
OMG IVE EXPLAINED THIS A THOUSAND TIMES

Gorinne Criggs:
And I am in no position to be going outside right now

me:
LOVE HAS NO CURFEW

Gorinne Criggs:
Oh really? So why can't you come over here then?

me:
YOU TEASE
IM BREATHING ON YOUR WINDOW!!!!

Gorinne Criggs:
Is that helping soothe your temptation? Or is it making it worse knowing I'm so close but you can't get to me

me:
YOU ARE SO DUMB NO WONDER REED DOESNT WANT YOU
