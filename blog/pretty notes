Why is it important to know that she is beautiful

its omportant because it makes her confident about her self, who she is

if women knew that they were beautiful then they would be less tempted to 
follow the worlds standards of "beauty" and be more like them selves

who God wants them to be

wooing?

yes it is imporant. it is like the cherry one top. 
it makes it exra scpecial. Wooing is good but it isnt the 
whole relationship. You build it out of more imporant things like 
trust, honesty, going thorugh hardships.
every once in a while you need to do things outside the usual for your loved
one to know that they are special. its kinda like dating. When you spend 
extra effort on a girl it lets her know that you think that she 
is worth the time and effort from the guy.
