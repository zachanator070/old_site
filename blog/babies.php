					 <h3>13 Nov 2014</h3>
					 <p>
						This last week in class we talked about "family planning" or as many people would just say simply birth control. Here is the
						wonderful thing about class though that was rather unusual for this class. Typically there is a topic presented and
						Dr. Goodman gives teachings and counsel from the scriptures and from church authorities about the topic and there
						are regularly little to non misunderstandings about what he is trying to protray to us. But this week this concept went
						right out the window with the rest of my understanding about relativaty and quantum mechanics.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Dr. Goodman literaly said that there no counsel on what to do or choose in terms of birth control in relation to scripture or
						even from church leaders. In fact he presented a time when the prophet himself wouldn't even tell his own daughter what he felt about it.
						From this and other quotations there was really little to grasp onto and so I decided that I would do a bit more investigation to better
						define for myself when it would be a good time to have kids. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						In my approach generally, I try to get a wide variety of opinions on the topics at hand so that I won't have any sort of bias. For some reason
						I decided to go to the first logical place for any source of knowledge about life skills, my 16 year old litle sister Sophie. When I asked her questions
						I wasn't looking for any answers concerning birth conrtol or methodologies like that but what her general feeling about having kids was and about being a mother.
						Her answers were clear and dinifinitive as I was expecting when asked how many kids she would want she said "more than one I guess." The real suprising thing however, was 
						that when asked why she said that she wanted her kids to have siblings because siblings can connect to you in ways that your parents can't. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						When asked about her peers she said "A lot of people aren't really into the idea of having kids at school. No one is really 
						decisive about it and is not really set about having kids. I feel like if anyone was excited about being a parent it would be the girls at church. Girls
						at school feel like that the rewards for the risk, pain and effort, isn't worth the rewards." I think it was very interesting to see that she noticed a social pressure 
						against having children on her friends at school compared at church where they were more excited about this. It doesn't suprise me that girls at a mormon church were
						excited about motherhood, but that it almost seems as if kids feel like having kids is not a net gain. You can see the problems that could arise from
						this sort of thinking at a young age.
					 </p>

						After my sister I consulted my father about this knowning that he had a little bit more experience with kids than my 16 year old sister did. When asked what he thought about
						having kids he said "I think the key factor for us was that we clearly decided to have children. We were married late as well so we were in a little different situation.
						was the marriage stable? was the child bring more stress? The first year we didn't consider it as we were getting to know each other better.
						I was weighing your mothers decision more than mine becuase her responsibility was to care for the kids. I was more worried about 
						providing for the family. We decided mom was going to stay home and I was in a situation that I could bring in enough
						income for everyone. It was 2 and a half years till we had kayla. The first one was the most important because it was the greatest sacrifice. 
						We barely had furniture and we decided to have a child. It can ruin you or define you. 
						It would be foolish to bring a child into this world with out being able to provide for it.
						Once finances were taken care of it was more of a concern about child care and time for the kids.
						The number and timing was pretty dependent on mom and I tried not to put any pressure on her. 
						We decided to have another child after the proceeding one.
						At one point we had to sacrifice as I was going to night school and was not able to help at home so it was a real struggle for mom.
						A ton of emphasis was put on mom and economics."
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Armed with this knowledge I asked Alyssum the very dangerous question about what she felt as well. While I was doing this I saw an imediate gratidute that I asked
						because it helped us realize our life goals a little bit better. We realized that planning was going to be the center around our descision but at the same time
						recognizing that it could change at any point given that maybe God has something differently planned for us. I like to think that we are now preparing the 
						way to have a family and to be able to provide first and foremost. I liked how my dad put it that "it can ruin you or define you."
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So bottom line is that I learned something new about Alyssum this week and it was a good thing to talk about and understand as a couple. Really it depends on the person
						when to have kids but I would say that it is definately a good idea else it would kind of contradictory based upon my existence was decided by my parents making the same 
						decision 22 fateful years ago. With this I will leave you all to your kids or lack of, and wish you all a good week as well.
