				 	 <h3>30 March 2015</h3>
				 	 
				 	 <p>
						Hello all it's me again. This week was pretty crazy. First off I have a humorous story to share. So you know how when people get up to
						talk and ALWAYS start off by saying "Oh such-and-such called me and told me to talk about XYZ and I said yes" which is kind of a lame
						story and I avoided it for a good reason too. This last week we were asked to speak about conferance that is coming up and I got one of 
						those calls from the bishopric. The thing was that I was on the toilet at the time and didn't want to call him back or do this phone tag business that I 
						usually do with people. So I just picked up and had a nice converstion while in the bathroom. I came out and Alyssum was rather confused cause she thought
						I was talking with myself. I told her she and I were speaking next week and told her that I should do the same routine that everyone else does.
						Needless to say she didn't think it was very funny cause sometimes my obnoxious jokes aren't too funny to others. What ever, it would have
						been a good ice breaker lol.
				 	 </p>
				 	 
				 	 <p>
						On other news we were invited to the MTC to hear Alyssum's dad speak in a devotional for all the missionaries in the Provo MTC. It really brought back memories 
						of the horrible weeks that I spent there. It was really different this time cause I knew I would be going home to sleep in my own bed however. It kind of shocked
						Alyssum that I didn't have a good time in the MTC. All my comanions will tell you the same thing. It was just like a prison to me and all I wanted was to go
						to New York the whole time. I wrote some pretty frustrated letters home and good thing my mom is a siant cause she was able to help me 
						have the patience to get through it. 
				 	 </p>
				 	 
				 	 <p>
						So we spent the evening with Alyssum's family as usual and met the president of the MTC and some other missionaries along the way. When I was introduced 
						during the meeting I was referred to as the "son in law." So afterwords all these elders were coming up to me and saying "oh you must be the son in law."
						What does that mean? I fit PERFECTLY in the family. Something must be wrong with people these days.
				 	 </p>
				 	 
				 	 <p>
						So yeah that was the week. Filled with talks and devotionals. It was really good and helped me get through the rest of school that I had to plow through.
						I was able to read more of the biography of James Gammel and learned some more about the cool people that he had met and conversed with. Last time
						we left off where he had just decided to go to the Salt Lake valley to dwell there with the saints. While there he had made a ditch machine that was
						able to make ditches on the sides of roads. His experience in Van Dieman's land made him one of the better road makers in the valley and he was
						eventually commisioned to be the head of road construction. He was apointed by brother Brigham Young himself. Cool eh?
				 	 </p>
				 	 
				 	 <p>
						While working in Salt Lake he was taught the gospel and was eventually baptized. It doesn't give much surrounding his conversion but it doesn't suprise me
						that he would do that considering that he was a really religious man himself. The cool part about his conversion story was that he was baptized by Parly P. Pratt
						who is known as pretty much the greatest missionary in mormon history. It was after then he met a woman by the name of Elizabeth Hendricks. After a short courtship 
						they were married by once again Brigham Young in front of the family bath house. Now this bath house must have been cool or something because it was built around
						a natural spring in Salt Lake and it was the family business. It was rather famous for helping people overcome ailments. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						The bath house was owned by Elizabeth's parents. Now the Hendricks family had come from Missouri and all the horrible things that happened there to the mormons
						at the time. Elizabeth's father was actually shot in the neck by a mob and was rendered paralyzed from the neck down. After a few blessings from Joseph Smith Sr.
						he eventually was able to walk again eventually over the plains to the Salt Lake Valley. The part that really got me there was SHOT IN THE NECK AND RECOVERED.
						So it was really amazing to see the union of these two families especially knowing thier religious background. The more amazing part I think was some home
						Elizabeth saw something in the revolutionary mountain man that was James Gammel. Kind of reminds me of Alyssum.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Haha well I'll tell you what though, she didn't marry me for the pastey white skin or the balding head THAT'S for sure.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Well that's all for this week. I have other things to do at the momement now (like OTHER homework) but I wish you all adieu untill next time.
						Until then have a happy life and don't let it wiegh you down either.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>Haha. I was so tired by then...</p>
