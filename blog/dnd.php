					 <h3>20 March 2015</h3>
					 <p>
						This weekend was rather fun for me. It was a time that I was able to relax for just a moment in time 
						from the raging storm of school, work, and life in general. On Friday we were able to go visit the 
						french boys, namely Parker and Breyton, and we played in thier fancy jaccuzi. It was a fun play date.
						After that we were able to play some munchkins which was a rather heated battle. I say heated because 
						munchkins is a game were the first person to attempt victory usually gets an onslaught of attacks that 
						every one has been holding onto for the whole game. So with that in mind Alyssum was the first to go for the 
						win. Brey attempted to help her but his efforts were futile. They ended up both dying which usually means they 
						have no chance at winning the rest of the game. I grabbed Alyssum's elf card and hatched a secret plan with Parker.
						Parker had a lvl 1 itsy bitsy spider and I was an elf which means if we both killed the spider we would both go
						up to lvl 10 and WIN THE GAME!!! So that's what we did.					 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So the next day was Saturday, and Alyssums cousin Toni (AKA Tony the Tiger, AKA Tony Romo, AKA Tido) was planning
						on staying the night with us so she could spend the weekend down in Provo. The next day the three of us would play
						dungeons and dragons with some other friends. I must say that after a couple of weeks of stressing out about my CS project
						I was ready for this. In DnD my character has a rather... explosive personality and I have a spell that is a small
						explosion. By the end of the session I had blown up a ship and 3 other pirates on the docs. It was a magnificent
						feat. One thing that is blatantly obvious from the past couple of sessions that we have is that Nate, YEAH YOU NATE IF
						YOU ARE READING THIS, is totally biased towards girls that play. Both Alyssum and Toni both went up two levels from 
						playing even though I blew up a ship! Next week I will just have to bring a bribe or something.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So yeah this weekend was really fun. On other news I was able to have another internship interview. Hopefully they liked
						my code that I showed them. You know it is like the most stressful moment of your life when you only have like 15 minutes to 
						prove your worth to someone. What do you show them? What do you say? Why is the internet connection so bad? All of these
						questions were ones that I had when having this interview. Gosh I feel like if there was a better connection our skype call
						would not have been as bad. Anyway I really hope that I can go down to Texas for the summer. That would just be perfect
						and I could get some real experience in a developement invironment. Getting a job sucks. I found that I ran into the same
						catch 22 where you can't have a really good resume unless you have good experience which you need a good job from. I guess
						that is what interns are for, cheep labor to prove your worth. Here we go I guess.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So James Gammell. Last week we learned that he had successfully made it home from Austrailia by the skin of his teeth. He 
						arrived home with a heros welcome and in leu of his experiences, his story was published around the country. He saught out his brother
						who was at the time living in New York and James ended up living there for a few years. Something that was a constant theme in James'
						 life was that he was always on a quest for adventure and he was restless at times. He found the urge to move out to Michigan where 
						 he later successfully convinced the rest of his family to move out to as well. In stead of writing letters, he found him self personally greeting
						 family. His poor mother was everywhere between hope and dispair when he was in captivity and was much to her relief to be living closer to him.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						You know this often reminds me of my own mother. I has the worst habbit of not calling her (I know, I'm the worst son in the world) so I think
						that I relate to James sometimes. Just gotta spread your wings and fly sometimes haha. Sorry mom I really do love you I promise.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						James ends up marying a gal by the name Maridith Fitzgerald. James had a son named Orlin and all was well untill Maridith died. As disapointing as
						that is that's all the book says about her. Maried James, game birth and died. Kind of a sad story especially as it left James in a rather emotional state.
						He later married Edith Campbell but 7 months later the marriage is aperently done with because James heads west. Yes James leaves his wife and son and
						heeds to the call of the west. This time he heads out on the Oregon trail to a camp called Fort Bridger. I say camp because it was a trading post consisting of 
						a couple of cabins in the middle of the woods. Not even a wall. James recalls how it was hardly fort-like as well. I guess fort standards weren't as high back
						then.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Upon arriving to the fort he meets Jim Bridger himself who was a famous explorer at the time. Jim had traveled all over the Rocky's and was known for
						mapping them. He spoke English, Spanish, and French as well as 4 Indian dialects. James accompanied Jim on a 7 month adventure through the Rocky's and
						hunted/trapped a lot of game. A real mountain man expedition. More background on Jim was that he was the one that discovered YellowStone national park
						as well as the great Salt Lake. Aparently he followed the Bear River down until he came to a lake that tasted like brine. Everyone called him crazy cause it
						sounded like he found the Pacific Ocean.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						After his mountain man adventure James found his way into the Salt Lake valley to find work among the community of mormons there. I'll leave it there for now
						because I think we all know what will happen there. Or at least how he seems to be related to the rest of my family haha. Anyway much thanks to you all and have a 
						great week as always. BYEBYE!!!
