					 <p>
						So I had a pretty awesome week. I only say that because valentines day was the best day ever! If you can recall
						it was this time last year that I was able to woo the allusive Alyssum Teh to fall in love with me. On that fatefull day 
						a year ago I took her to the symphony and made her steak with a delish cheese cake. Was I successful?
						Well her name is Alyssum Johnson now so you do the math. Steak + cheesecake = wife.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						To commemorate this glorious time in our love life I decided to relive this day with more steak and good food. Guys listen
						up. Right here right now I will impart some sage words of advice. If you can prove your worthiness to a female through
						the art of cuisine, she will become a faithful customer and will come back for more. It's often said that the fastest way to 
						a man's heart is through his stomach but I offer an opposite side of the coin where a college guys for a general part of the populous
						lack any sort of tallent in the cooking field. So at ANY display, I mean ANY display of tallent in that field will make the 
						ladies come flocking.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Enough pro tips. We are moving on.

						So I also was able to get Alyssum one other gift. She had asked for this a couple of weeks ago. I wasn't sure if
						she was serious or joking at first but I later realized that she meant it haha. So I shopped on Amazon and found 
						the best onesie I could find. A pikachu onesie in fact. She makes me crack up every time I see her in it and it
						is another testimony to me that we were obviously a good fit for each other haha.

						This week I was able to read more about my ancestor James Gammell and it was a rather eventful reading. I found out that his
						family actually lived in New York City for a while! Sweet I am already liking this guy. While in New York his family ran an inn 
						that was popular for traveling scott seamen. As a child he would sit at the top of the stairs over looking the tavern and listen
						to the tall tales that the sailors would share. These tall tales were thought to invoke his sense of adventure. Along with 
						this ealy eagerness for adventure and his political, patriotic background that his family had a tradition of, he moved
						from the eastern coast to Canada to live with his uncle. After rumors of uprising from the British crown, James was more than willing
						to join in the fight against a government that was over taxing its colonies. "The Canadian Patriot War" as it was called,
						started and soon most of the "patriots" were pushed out of the country into the United States.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Having just gone though a revolution, citizens of the United States were willing to help out the Canadian cause. Because most patriots were 
						then dwelling on US soil, attacks would frequent across the boarder to raid British buildings and settlements. James Gammell found himself on
						one such raid in the name of the patriot cause. Because of a lack of understanding from both the invading party and the welcoming patriot party,
						there were not enough men to conduct the raid and thus they led an unsuccesful attack. Having been pushed back and then retreating across the boarder,
						James was nearly at the border when his "companion," who was not well spoken of, told a boarder British officer that James was a Lieutenant in the 
						patriot ranks. He was taken in custody and thrown into jail where he awaited his sentence.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						He watched a fellow officer hang at the gallows and he and the rest of his captured commrads were doomed to the same traitorous fate. Many of the patriots 
						were desperate enough to write home to loved ones and to political leaders to convince the local British government to pardon them as they had not killed
						anyone in their attacks. The British were "won" over and sentenced the prisoners to a life sentence on the island of Van Diemen's Land. This was 
						hardly good news since the place was viewed as prisoner's version of hell on Earth, but at least they weren't dead. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So after reading that cheery news I decided what better place to stop. Next time it could only get better right? At least James wasn't dead yet! 
						I guess he wasn't thinking the same thing since it sounds like he would be going to an insufferable place in the middle of the ocean but hey, I have high hopes
						for the guy. He hasn't even married yet and I know that that part of the story HAS to happen or there is something terribly wrong with this timeline.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Thanks everyone for reading and as always have a great week and I will hopefully write another entry before the week is over. Cheers!
