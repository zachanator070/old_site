					 <h3>23 Nov 2014</h3>
					 <p>
						What a glorious week ahead. I can finally breathe now and Turkey Day is right around the corner. My folks are coming in town and it will
						be very interesting as I will be having two thanksgivings. One with my grandma and the rest of my family and then one with Alyssum and her family. One thing that is 
						a family tradition of ours is to go around the table and say one thing that we are thankful for. A combination of this and a speaker at church led me to think about
						what I was actually thankful for and what this could do for me in marriage. </p>
					
					<p>
					I remember in my mission we often tried to develop this attribute of being thankful by saying a prayer with nothing more than thanks to God for everything and anything that
					we could think of that has affected our lives in one way or another. In doing so we began to see that our problems were almost nothing compared to our blessings and that God
					had already given us. It really put things into perspective for us and allowed us to see a bigger and brighter picture. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
					 So this week, in spirit of the holliday, I wanted to put down as many things I could think of that I am thankful for in hopes to be a more positive person who looks forward into the future.
					 </p>
