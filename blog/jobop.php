					 <h3>22 Feb 2015</h3>
					 <p>
					Well howdy every one. Did you have a good week? Cause I did, and let me tell you about it. 
					The success of the week actually started off many years ago. As some of you may
					know I have a bit of a hobby with technology. Ever since I was 16 I was thrown into the 
					vast world of computer technology and programming when I first got my very own computer.
					This stemmed further when I took a hight school class from probably the best
					high school teacher that ever came to mckinney. In AP Computer Science I first learned
					html and java which led to the creation of my very own website. Ladies and gentlemen the site you
					still has code that was written when I was 16, and that is probably why it looks so bad lol.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Since I have returned home from my mission I have been an enthusiast for the board game
						dungeons and dragons. With this new found love for a game I began to develop
						a page on my site that was dedicated to the support of this game. I have since then created
						a home brew version of dungeon and dragons and have made a site that hass supported the creation of
						characters for the game. The page saves the status of your character and enables you to keep
						everything paperless. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						 Understanding this we can now talk about this week. Mom I hope you are reading because it was
						 literally because of this Dungeon and Dragon's site that I was able to get an interview
						 with a company from my home town. I was so proud of my site because it highlighted abilities that
						 I had aquired over the years that school had not taught me. It was my unique representation of my skills
						 that made me stand out from other people and as a result it paid off. Anyway I scored this 
						 sweet interview and I am waiting to hear back to see if I got the internship. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
					 If you are interested, here is the url for the site that I've been talking about:<br/>

					 <p>
						So enough geeking around, Alyssum always is telling me that sometimes I geek out a little
						too much for other people to care but you know I bet a lot of people don't have thier own
						website and get cool job oportunities from it. Let me have some glory! In other events I was able 
						to read about James Gammell and this week it was kind of depressing but yet inspiring to read more
						of his story.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						So after being captured and given thier sentence, the Patriots that were joined with James had to go to England
						for thier trial first in England as was the tradition of the time before anyone went to Van Dieman's land. This part of the
						story was the really depressing part because it pretty much consisted of the british trying to make up thier minds
						as to when they would ship the prisoners off to England. Because of thier "timely" effort the patriot prisoners
						found themselves in some real welcoming prisons in the eastern part of Canada. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						During one transportation from one prison to another, James and his company were shoved onto a steam boat with a bunch of livestock
						and were put into chains. They said that there was no space to sit and there was barely enough to stand. After the two day journey had come to a close,
						many were found slumped on the floor in animal waste from the exhaustion of standing for so long with iron shackles around thier wrists and feet.
						So yeah after I had read that I was pretty discusted but then it gets worse!
						So if that doesn't sound like the time of your life then just wait. 
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						They had finally arived in Quebec they had found much better food and lodging from the prison there. There was a noteworthy reverand there
						that took particular fondness to the freedom fighters and had regarded the men as a very religious group. It absolutely amazed me that
						these group of rag-tag men were still religious in thier imprisonment. I wonder if this is the case these days as usually in times
						of crisis people tend to turn thier backs on God, blaming Him for thier troubles. But in James' case it was the exact opposite interstingly
						enough.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						While in Quebec they were finally awoken in the middle of the night, put into iron shackles again, and shipped to England on the
						ship Captain Ross. Now the Captain Ross was a special boat for these men as many later described it as the worst hell hole that 
						any of them had experienced in the entirety of their lives. While on the boat, the prisoners were paired in twos and James Gammell was
						paired off with Miller Linus. When they were about to go underdeck to the prisoner barracks their hearts sank as they thought that they were
						descending to thier tombs from the sight and smells that they witnessed. On the journey across the Atlantic they all recorded how awfull
						the sights and smells continued to make everyone more sick. Disease ran rampant and they were all freezing to death from the northern 
						weather. They said they would have a moment of relief when a wave of freezing cold artic water would spill over the frozen deck down into
						the hull of the ship and give the prisoners a much needed bath from the human waste and vomit that they had been living in.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						After expecting to die in an eternal pit of sewage, the prisoners of the Captain Ross found themselves experienceing a miracle as they entered the bay
						of Liverpool and had seen land again. The people of liverpool were seen weeping and shocked as the prisoners unloaded from under the deck
						covered in the mess that they had witstood. Now, already here in the story I am honestly suprised that NO ONE DIED from the journey across 
						the Atlantic and it is in my humble opinion that surely God had acted in these fateful mens lives to where they once again stood on solid 
						ground.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						After reading this horrific tale I was inspired a little more knowing that tomorrow may be bad, but at least I won't be stuck in a 
						barrel of poo rolling across the ocean. That is it for this week ladies and gentlemen. Have a great week and I pray that you will not face
						a barrel of poo this week either.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						Oh yeah and here is my beautiful wife. :)
